// Plain data, deliberately split out of currency-context.tsx (a "use
// client" module) — server code (like /api/booking/route.ts, via
// booking-currencies.ts) needs this list too, and importing a named export
// from a "use client" file into server code doesn't reliably survive
// bundling (confirmed: it broke the build with "CURRENCIES.filter is not a
// function", the client-component proxy standing in for the real array).
